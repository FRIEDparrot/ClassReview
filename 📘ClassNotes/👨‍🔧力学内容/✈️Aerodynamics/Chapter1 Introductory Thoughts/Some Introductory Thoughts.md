The resultant aerodynamic force is frequently resolved into two components defined as **lift and Drag**, but aerodynamics deal  instead with lift and drag coefficients 

## 1.1 Importance of aerodynamics & Examples

Newton assumed that upon striking a surface inclined at an angle $\theta$ to the stream, the particles would transfer their normal momentum to the surface and the tangential  momentum would be preserved, which leads the expression for the hydrodynamic force on the surface as $sin^2\theta$  ->  sine-squared law of Newton

Euler pointed out the physical Inconsistency of the Newton's model and noted the fluid moving to a body "before reaching the latter, bends its direction and its velocity so when it reaches the body it flows past it along the surface"


for the theory of the long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles: 
in 1951 H. Julian Allen at the NACA Ames Aeronautical Laboratory,  introduced the concept of the *blunt* reentry body.

in that case, the way  to increase the  heating of the airflow is to  create a strong shock wave at the nose -> so  we can **use the reentry bodies rather than slender bodies to minimize the aerodynamic heating**

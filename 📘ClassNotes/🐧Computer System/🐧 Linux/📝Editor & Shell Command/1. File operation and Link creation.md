create external Link :
```sh
ln -s  ./www/acb/sadf/project  ~/proj   # create a symbolic  link 
```

```sh fold title:Full-instruction of ln 
$ ln --help
Usage: ln [OPTION]... [-T] TARGET LINK_NAME
  or:  ln [OPTION]... TARGET
  or:  ln [OPTION]... TARGET... DIRECTORY
  or:  ln [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY TARGET...
In the 1st form, create a link to TARGET with the name LINK_NAME.
In the 2nd form, create a link to TARGET in the current directory.
In the 3rd and 4th forms, create links to each TARGET in DIRECTORY.
Create hard links by default, symbolic links with --symbolic.
By default, each destination (name of new link) should not already exist.
When creating hard links, each TARGET must exist.  Symbolic links
can hold arbitrary text; if later resolved, a relative link is
interpreted in relation to its parent directory.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
      --backup[=CONTROL]      make a backup of each existing destination file
  -b                          like --backup but does not accept an argument
  -d, -F, --directory         allow the superuser to attempt to hard link
                                directories (note: will probably fail due to
                                system restrictions, even for the superuser)
  -f, --force                 remove existing destination files
  -i, --interactive           prompt whether to remove destinations
  -L, --logical               dereference TARGETs that are symbolic links
  -n, --no-dereference        treat LINK_NAME as a normal file if
                                it is a symbolic link to a directory
  -P, --physical              make hard links directly to symbolic links
  -r, --relative              with -s, create links relative to link location
  -s, --symbolic              make symbolic links instead of hard links
  -S, --suffix=SUFFIX         override the usual backup suffix
  -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY  specify the DIRECTORY in which to create
                                the links
  -T, --no-target-directory   treat LINK_NAME as a normal file always
  -v, --verbose               print name of each linked file
      --help        display this help and exit
      --version     output version information and exit

The backup suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.
The version control method may be selected via the --backup option or through
the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:

  none, off       never make backups (even if --backup is given)
  numbered, t     make numbered backups
  existing, nil   numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise
  simple, never   always make simple backups

Using -s ignores -L and -P.  Otherwise, the last option specified controls
behavior when a TARGET is a symbolic link, defaulting to -P.

## File to std output

such as `cat` , `tee`  
### (1) Cat  
print the content of the file 
```sh 
 cat /etc/exports   # output the file content  
cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt  # print  
```

### (2) tee  
```sh fold 
Usage: tee [OPTION]... [FILE]...
**Copy standard input to each FILE, and also to standard output.** 
  -a, --append              append to the given FILEs, do not overwrite
  -i, --ignore-interrupts   ignore interrupt signals
  -p                        operate in a more appropriate MODE with pipes.
      --output-error[=MODE]   set behavior on write error.  See MODE below
      --help        display this help and exit
      --version     output version information and exit

MODE determines behavior with write errors on the outputs:
  warn           diagnose errors writing to any output
  warn-nopipe    diagnose errors writing to any output not a pipe
  exit           exit on error writing to any output
  exit-nopipe    exit on error writing to any output not a pipe
```

such as **echo the string into std output and then append it to some files** : 
```sh
echo "/home/mpiuser/cloud *(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)" | sudo tee -a /etc/exports
```

### (3) grep   
pair the sentence with the

in the freestream, far ahead the body, We define a dimensionless quality called ***Freestream Pressure*** as

Dynamic Pressure: 
$$q_\infty \equiv \frac{1}{2} \rho _\infty V_\infty^2$$
The dynamic pressure has the units of $Pa$, and the we let $S$ as a reference area and $l$ as the reference length. And $\rho_\infty$ is the density and the $V_\infty$ is the velocity

1. Lift coefficient
$$C_L \equiv \frac{L}{q_\infty S}$$
2. Drag coefficient
$$C_D \equiv \frac{D}{q_\infty S}$$
3. Normal Force coefficient
$$C_N \equiv \frac{N}{q_\infty S}$$
4. Axial Force coefficient
$$C_A \equiv \frac{A}{q_\infty S}$$
5. Moment coefficient
$$C_M \equiv \frac{M}{q_\infty Sl }$$

Note that the choice is not critical, but we must get to know what reference quantities are based on.

## 1.12 Applied Aerodynamics : The Aerodynamic coefficients

The applied aerodynamics implies the application of the aerodynamics.
In this section we address the aerodynamic coefficients defined in [[1-11 Some Introductory Thoughts#1.5 Aerodynamic Forces and moments|Section1-5]]

for an incompressible flow, the Mach number is theoretically zero, not because the velocity goes to zero, but rather because the speed of sound is infinitely large. Thus, for a low-speed flow, **the aerodynamic coefficients for a fixed shape at a fixed orientation to the flow are functions of ==just the Reynolds number==**.
$$Re = \frac{\rho_\infty V_\infty d}{\mu_\infty} $$
the flow fields over the configurations shows a weak downstream of the body. Which is caused by the flow separating from the body surface, with a low-energy, recirculating flow inside the wake.

Note in particular that the physical effect of the streamlining in Figure 1.54c results in a very small wake, hence a small value for the drag coefficient.

For the large streamlined body in Figure 1.54c,
$$D' = q_∞SC_D = 0.12q_∞d$$
For the small circular cylinder in Figure 1.54d,
$$D' = q_∞SC_D = q_∞(0.1d)(1.2) = 0.12q_∞d$$
and they are exactly the same.

Also note that the $C_D$ decrease precipitously at the higher Reynolds number. the answer of this would be shown in section 3.18

Note the values of $C_D$ for the *aerodynamic shapes* in $Figure 1.54$. $C_D$ is based on the ***frontal projected area (S = d(1) per unit span)***, and the values of $C_D$ range from a maximum of 2 to numbers as low as 0.12 is typical values of $C_D$ in aerodynamic bodies.

Note that the **drag of the vertical flat plate and the circular cylinders is dominated by pressure drag**, whereas, in contrast, **most of the drag of the streamlined body is due to skin friction**. Indeed, this type of comparison leads to the definition of two *generic body shapes* in aerodynamics, as: 
$$\text{Blunt Body} = \text{a body where most of the drag is pressure drag}$$
$$\text{Stramlined Body} = \text{a body where most of the drag is skin friction drag}$$

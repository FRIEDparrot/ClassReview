the lowest possible velocity is related to the maximum lift coefficient $C_{L,max}$ as indicated in
[[1-11 Some Introductory Thoughts#2. Design utilities]]

the lowest speed may instead be dictated by the *power required to maintain level flight* exceeding the power available from the powerplant. -> occurs on the "back side" of the power curve.

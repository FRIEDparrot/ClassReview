The resultant aerodynamic force is frequently resolved into two components defined as **lift and Drag**, but aerodynamics deal  instead with lift and drag coefficients 

## 1.1 Importance of aerodynamics & Examples

Newton assumed that upon striking a surface inclined at an angle $\theta$ to the stream, the particles would transfer their normal momentum to the surface and the tangential  momentum would be preserved, which leads the expression for the hydrodynamic force on the surface as $sin^2\theta$  ->  sine-squared law of Newton

Euler pointed out the physical Inconsistency of the Newton's model and noted the fluid moving to a body "before reaching the latter, bends its direction and its velocity so when it reaches the body it flows past it along the surface"


for the theory of the long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles: 
in 1951 H. Julian Allen at the NACA Ames Aeronautical Laboratory,  introduced the concept of the *blunt* reentry body.

in that case, the way  to increase the  heating of the airflow is to  create a strong shock wave at the nose -> so  we can **use the reentry bodies rather than slender bodies to minimize the aerodynamic heating**

## 1.2 Classification and Practical objectives
When a force is applied tangentially to the surface of a solid, the solid will experience a finite deformation,  and the tangential force per unit area(shear stress) would usually be proportional to the amount of deformation. 

fluid dynamics is subdivided into three areas as: 
1. hydrodynamics -- flow of liquids
2. Gas dynamics -- flow of gases
3. Aerodynamics -- flow of air

It's important for we to know about the source of the aerodynamic forces to obtain them by integrating the surface properties. 

important concepts in chapter 1: 
1. lift, drag, and the moment coefficients
2. center of pressure
3. dimensional Analysis and the  flow similarity
4. fluid statics
5. concept of the boundary layer

## 1.4 Some fundamental aerodynamic variables
the pressure, density, temperature, and flow velocity are all fundamental concepts 
the pressure at point B in a volume of fluid is defined as: 
$$p = \lim \frac{dF}{dA} \qquad dA \to 0$$
where the pressure $p$ is defined as the force per unit area. 

the density $\rho$ is defined as: 
$$\rho=\lim\frac{dm}{dv} $$
the temperature $T$ of the gas is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the molecular  kinetic energy of the molecules of the fluid.  
if the temperature is given by $E_k = \frac{3}{2}kT$ $\Rightarrow \text{k is the Boltzmann constant}$
where the $E_k$  is the average kinetic energy of the single molecular.
$$\text{Boltzmann constant:} \quad  k=1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \spaceÂ J/K $$
Hence we can qualitatively visualize a high-temperature gas as one in which the molecular and atoms are randomly rattling. 

the concept of the velocity is more subtle than that of a solid body. For the fluid is a "Squishy" substance, and for a fluid in motion, one part of the fluid may be travel at different speed from another part. 

we consider a  fluid element in the following picture:

as long as the flow is steady the path which is the traces of a moving fluid element.

the specific heat is defined as the amount of the heat added to a system $\delta q$, per unit volume temperature increase $\delta T$
$$c_v = \frac{\delta q}{\delta T}$$
($\delta q$ is added to the constant volume)

Discussed in detail in the chapter 7.2

The Thermal  conductivity relates the heat flux to temperature gradients in the fluid.

For the $\dot{q}_x$ denotes the heat transferred in the $x$ direction per unit area per second, and the temperature gradient is $\frac{dT}{dx}$
then the ==thermal conductivity== $\Large k$ is defined as: 
$$\dot{q}_x = -k \frac{dT}{dx}$$

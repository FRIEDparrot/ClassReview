according to the divergence theorem, we have
$$∰ \nabla \cdot V d\mathcal{V} = ∯_S  V \cdot \vec{n} \space dS$$
and 
$$∯_S V\cdot\vec{n} dS = \text{volume change of a element of fixed mass per unit time}$$
where we consider the control volume is infinitesimal and thus $\nabla \cdot V$ is a constant, then 
$$\nabla \cdot V = \text{rate of change of the volume}$$

also we can  reference the solution below (take care the derivative of the Jacobian matrix is one line at a time is differentiated, and eliminate the repeating lines ($k = 2$ and $k =3$)) (and finally sum the 3 determinants together)

in the solution above this, the Jacobian of the transformation is as follows:

Let $K$ equal the number of fundamental dimensionless required to describe the physical variables (mass $m$, length $l$, time $t$.) (hence in mechanics the dimension of the problem is $K=3$)

Let $P_1, P_2,..P_N$ represent the $N$ physical variables of *mass, length and time...* etc. and then
$$f_1(P_1, P_2, ....P_N) =0 \tag{1.24}$$
Let $\Pi_1, \Pi_2, ...\Pi_{N-K}$ describe the relation of the dimensionless products (called $\Pi$ products)
thus we have the relationship
$$f_2(\Pi_1, \Pi_2, ... \Pi_{N-K}) =0\tag{1.25}$$
where each $\Pi$ product is a dimensionless product of a set of $K$ physical variables. Then we have 
$$\begin{matrix}
\Pi_1 = f_3 (P_1, P_2,... P_K, P_{K+1}) \hfill \\
\Pi_2 = f_4 (P_1, P_2,... P_K, P_{K+2}) \hfill \\
..................\hfill \\
\Pi_{N-K} = f_5 (P_1, P_2,... P_K, P_{N})   \hfill \\
\end{matrix}\tag{1.26}$$
The Choice of the repeating variables, $P_1, P_2,.....P_K$ should be such that they include all the $K$ dimensions used in the problem. Also the dependent variable (like $R$ in the equation [[📘ClassNotes/👨‍🔧Mechanics/🌊Thermal and Fluid dynamics/✈️Aerodynamics/Chapter1 Introductory Thoughts/1-11 Some Introductory Thoughts#1.7 The Buckingham PI theorem (Dimensional Analysis)|eq 1.23]]) should ==appear in only one of== the $\Pi$ products

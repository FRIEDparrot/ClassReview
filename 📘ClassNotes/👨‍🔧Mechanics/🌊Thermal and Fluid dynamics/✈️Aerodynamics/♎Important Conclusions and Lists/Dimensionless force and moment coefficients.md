in the freestream, far ahead the body, We define a dimensionless quality called ***Freestream Pressure*** as

Dynamic Pressure: 
$$q_\infty \equiv \frac{1}{2} \rho _\infty V_\infty^2$$
The dynamic pressure has the units of $Pa$, and the we let $S$ as a reference area and $l$ as the reference length. And $\rho_\infty$ is the density and the $V_\infty$ is the velocity

1. Lift coefficient
$$C_L \equiv \frac{L}{q_\infty S}$$
2. Drag coefficient
$$C_D \equiv \frac{D}{q_\infty S}$$
3. Normal Force coefficient
$$C_N \equiv \frac{N}{q_\infty S}$$
4. Axial Force coefficient
$$C_A \equiv \frac{A}{q_\infty S}$$
5. Moment coefficient
$$C_M \equiv \frac{M}{q_\infty Sl }$$

Note that the choice is not critical, but we must get to know what reference quantities are based on. 

also note that the $C$ in the uppercase denotes the 3-D body force/moment 

it's conventional to denote the force/moment ==per unit span== by lowercase $c$ as: 
$$c_l \equiv \frac{L'}{q_\infty c} \quad c_d \equiv \frac{D'}{q_\infty c} \quad c_m \equiv \frac{M}{q_\infty c^2}$$
where $S = c(1) =c$
also, two additional dimensionless quantities of immediate use are:
Pressure coefficient: 
$$C_p \equiv \frac{p-p_\infty}{q_\infty}$$
Skin friction coefficient:
$$c_f \equiv \frac{\tau}{q_\infty}$$

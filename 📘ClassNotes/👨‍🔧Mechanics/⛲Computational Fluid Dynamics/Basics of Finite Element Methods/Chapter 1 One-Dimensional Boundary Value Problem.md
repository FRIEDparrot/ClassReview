## 1. Strong or Classical form of the 1-D boundary problem 

<mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">Main constituents of a finite element method</mark> for the solution of a boundary-value problems are
1. The variational or weak statement of the problem 
2. <mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">approximate solution of the variational equations</mark> through the use of "Finite Element Method". 

Firstly we suppose we want to solute the following differential equations as : 

$$u_{,xx} + l = 0\tag{1.1.1}$$
This equation is the governing equation of the ==transverse displacement== of a string in tension. And this equation also can be considered as governing equation for  ==longitudinal displacement== of an elastic rod. 

<mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">Note that the comma stands for differential here</mark> ($u_{xx} = \frac{d^2 u}{d x^2}$)ï¼Œ and $l$ is a given smooth, scalar-valued function defined on the unit interval. 
$$l : [0,1] \rightarrow  R$$
where $[0,1]$ is unit interval. For each $x\in [0,1], l(x)\in R$. Also, we have that $[0,1]$ is said to be the ***domain*** of $l$ and $R$ is the ***range***. 
we also use
$$\begin{matrix}
\Omega = ]0,1[ \qquad \text{(open)} \\
\bar{\Omega} = [0,1] \qquad \text{(close)}
\end{matrix}$$
The **boundary conditions** on the function u are: 
$$\begin{matrix}
u(1) = q  \\
-u_{,x}(0) = h 
\end{matrix}$$
In this condition, this type of boundary conditions lead to the so-called ***Two Point Boundary Value Problems*** 

Hence the strong form of the boundary value can be written as : 
$$(S)\quad \begin{cases}
\text{Given $l$ : $\bar{\Omega} \rightarrow R$ and constants $q$ and $h$, and then find $u : \bar{\Omega}\rightarrow  R$, such that :  }\\
u_{, xx}(x) + l(x) = 0 \qquad \text{on } \Omega \\
u(1) = q \\
-u_{,x}(0) = h
\end{cases}$$
When we write the $u_{,xx}+ l =0$ on $\Omega$, we mean $u_{,xx}(x) + l(x) = 0$ ==for all== $x\in \Omega$(whole zone are satisfy this differential equation), then we can easily obtain the exact solution of the $u$ as : 
$$u = q + (1- x)h + \int_{x}^{1} \left\{\int_{0}^{y}l(z) dz\right\}dy\tag{1.2.3}$$
where the $y$ and $z$ are used to <mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">denote dummy variables</mark>.

However , We are interested in developing schemes for obtaining approximate solutions to $(S)$ which can be applicable to much more complex situations in which exact solutions are not possible.

## 2. Weak or Variational Form of the Problem 
To define the weak, variational, counterpart of $(S)$, we need to characterize **two classes of functions**. 
1. The trail solutions (candidate solutions): 
In the solution of this problem, we require the solution to satisfy the boundary condition $u(1) = q$ , while <u>the other boundary condition will not be required in the definition</u>. Furthermore, for the solution make sense, we should require  that the <u>derivates of the trail solutions be squared-integrable</u>, which is, for a trial solution $u$, we have :
$$\boxed{\int_{0}^{1} (u_{,x})^2 dx < \infty \tag{1.3.1}}$$
`````ad-note
title: H1 function
collapse: open

The functions that satisfy the equation $(1.3.1)$ is called $H^1-\text{functions}$, also we denote that $u$ is a solution of $H^1$ as $u \in H^1([0,1])$ or $u \in H^1$. 
`````

Thus <mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">the collection of trail solutions</mark>, denoted by $\delta$, ==consists of all functions which have square-integrable derivates and  take on the value== at $x =1$, can be written as :
$$\delta = \left\{u | u \in H^1, u(1) = q \right\}$$

2. weighting functions 
The ***Weighting functions*** is also called ***Variations*** 
This collection is similar to the trail solutions except <mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">we require the homogenous counterpart (using the same order) of the q-boundary condition</mark>. which denotes that the boundary condition satisfy $w(1) =0$, we require the **weighting functions**. to satisfy $w(1) = 0$. This collection is denoted by $\mathcal{V}$ as : 
$$\mathcal{V} = \left\{ w|w\in H^1, w(1) = 0 \right\}$$
also we simplify the question by assuming that $l: \Omega \rightarrow R$ as being smooth. 
Given $l,q$ and $h$, as before. Find $u\in \delta$, such that for all $w \in\mathcal{V}$, then we have the suitable weak form of the boundary-value problem. 

we derive the weak form by integral the $w_{,x} u_{,x}$ , <mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">use partial integral and substitute the boundary condition</mark> $w(1) = 0$ into it. 
$$\int_{0}^{1} w_{,x} u_{,x} dx = \int_{0}^{1}u_{,x} dw =\left. u_{x} w\right|_{0}^1 -  \int_{0}^{1} u_{,xx} w(x) dx = \int_{0}^{1} wl dx + w(0) h$$
$$(W)\quad \boxed{\begin{cases}
\text{Given $l$,q,and $h$, Find $u \in \delta\space $ s.t. for all $w\in \mathcal{V}$  } \\
\int_{0}^{1} w_{,x} u_{,x} dx = \int_{0}^{1}wl dx + w(0)h
\end{cases}}$$
Formulations of this type are often called ***Virtual Work***. or ***Virtual Displacement***
and in the function $w$ is ***Virtual Displacements***

<mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">Hence the Variational equation is also called The equation of virtual work</mark>, It's also the ***weak*** or ***generalized solution***. 

Now we assume $u$ to be a weak solution, Thus $u \in \delta$; consequently $u(1) =  q$ and 
$$\int_{0}^{1} w_{,x} u_{,x} dx = \int_{0}^{1} wl dx + w(0)h$$
for all $w\in \mathcal{V}$, we integrate it by parts and also make use of $w(1) = 0$, then
$$0 = \int_{0}^{1} w(u_{,xx} + l ) dx + w(0)\left[ u_{,x}(0) +  h\right]$$
The proof of the proposition of this solution can be found in [[Proof of the proposition of 1-D FEM problem.pdf]]

`````ad-note

In the problem above, the boudnary condition is not mentioned explicitly, this type boundary conditions are referred as ***Natural Boundary Conditions***. The trail solutions are explicitly required to satisfy $u(1) = q$, This type of boundary conditions are called essential boundary conditions. 

$\space$

The prove of the propsition goes under the name of ***fundamental lemma*** in the literature of the calculus of variations.  

$\space$

the methodology enables us to deduce the differential equations and boundary conditions implied by the weak problems. 
`````

for obtaining an <mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">approximate solution to the original boundary-value problem</mark>, we have alternative starting points(i.e. The strong statement and the weak statement of the problem). FEM is based on the weak statement of the solution. 

Then we Let
$$\boxed{\begin{matrix}
a(w,u) = \int_{0}^{1} w_{,x} u_{,x} dx \\
(w,l) = \int_{0}^{1} wl dx 
\end{matrix}}$$
so we have the equation : 
$$\LARGE\boxed{a(w,u) = (w,l) + w(0)h}$$
`````ad-note

In the equation above, we note that $a(\cdot ,\cdot)$ and $(\cdot ,\cdot )$ are examples of symmertic and bilinear forms. 

The property ***Symmetry*** is :

(u,v) = (v,u)

The property ***Bilinearity*** is:

## 3. The Galerkin's Approximation method
#### 1) Preferences 
we now describe a method of obtaining an approximate solutions to boundary-value problems based on the weak formulations. The first step in developing the method is <mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">to construct a finite-dimensional approximation</mark> of $\delta$ and $\mathcal{V}$. which we can describe the collections as $\delta^h$ and $\mathcal{V}^h$ with a ***mesh***, or discretization, of the domain $\Omega$, which is parameterized by a characteristic length scale $h$. We wish to think of $\delta^h$ and $\mathcal{V}^h$ <mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">as being subset of</mark> $\delta$ and $\mathcal{V}$. 
$$\begin{matrix}
\delta^h \subset \delta \\
\mathcal{V}^h \subset \mathcal{V}
\end{matrix}$$
where $w^h$ is the *virtual displacement*, i.e.
$$\begin{matrix}
\text{if} \space u^h \in \delta^h , \text{then} \space u^h\in \delta \\
\text{if} \space w^h \in  \mathcal{V}^h, \text{then} \space w^h \in \mathcal{V}
\end{matrix}$$
The collections, $\delta, \mathcal{V},\delta^h, \mathcal{V}^h$ are often referred to as ***function spaces***

#### 2) Galerkin method
since the collection $\mathcal{V}^h$ is given, to each member $v^h\in \mathcal{V}^h$, we will construct a function $u^h \in \delta^h$ by 
$$u^h = v^h + q^h\tag{1.5.5}$$
where $q^h$ is a given function <mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">satisfying the essential boundary condition</mark>. i.e.
$$u^h(1) = v^h(1) + q^h(1)$$
so we can now write a variational equation in terms of $w^h \in \mathcal{V}^h$ and $u^h \in \delta^h$, which is the ***discrete weak Form*** of the equation :
$$(W_h): \quad  \boxed{a(w^h, u^h) = (w^h , l) + w^h(0)h}\tag{1.5.8}$$
substitute $(1.5.5)$ into $(1.5.8)$, and we reach the ***Galerkin Weak Form*** $G$ : 
$$\Large (G): \quad \begin{cases}
\text{Given $l,q,h$, find $u^h = v^h + q^h$, where $v^h\in \mathcal{V}^h$} \\
\text{s.t. for all $w^h \in \mathcal{V}^h$}\\
a(w^h, v^h) = (w^h, l) + w^h(0) h - a(w^h, q^h) 
\end{cases}\tag{1.5.9}$$
This equation is sometimes referred to as ***Galerkin equation***

Approximation methods of the type considered are examples of so-called ***weighted residual methods***. 

## 4. Matrix Equations, Stiffness Matrix $K$
#### 1) Linear Combinations Definitions 
we let the $\mathcal{V}^h$ <mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">consists of all linear combinations of given functions denoted by</mark> $N_A: \bar{\Omega} \rightarrow R$, where $A = 1,2,....n$, as : 
$$w^h = \sum^{n}_{A=1} c_A N_A$$
where $N_A$'s are referred to as ***Shape, Basis or interpolation function***. Since $w^h(1) = 0$, we have $N_A(1) = 0$, hence obviously that the $\mathcal{V}^h$ have dimensions $n$. 

For defining $\delta^h$, we need to specify $q^h$  and also we introduce  another ***Shape Function*** $N_{n+1}$as : 
$$N_{n+1}: \bar{\Omega} \rightarrow R , \qquad  N_{n+1} (1) = 1$$
thus the $q^h$ is given by 
$$q^h = qN_{n+1}\qquad  q^h(1) = q$$
Using this definitions, we can write $u^h$ in the linear combination form : 
$$\boxed{u^h = \sum^{n}_{A=1} N_A d_A + q N_{n+1}}\tag{1.6.6}$$
where the $d_A$'s are constants. 

`````ad-caution 
collapse: close
since $u^h \in \delta^h$ , we assume that $u^h = \sum^{n}_{A=1} d_A N_A$, and also, $w^h$ is the weighting functions, $w^h \in \mathcal{V}^h$, which is also the linear combination of the functions $N_A$

. 

also we assume that $v_h \in \mathcal{V}^h$, then we also have the combination form as : 
$$u^h = v^h + q^h$$
where 
$$w^h = \sum^{n}_{A=1} c_A N_A$$
$$v^h = \sum^{n}_{A=1} d_A N_A$$
$$u^h = \sum^{n}_{A=1} d_A N_A + q^hN_{n+1}$$
we wrote $d_B N_B$ in the derivation for the distinction of different functions 
`````

using the derivation process [[Derivations of the Stiffness Matrix in FEM.pdf]]

we may state the matrix equivalent of the Galerkin problem as : 
$$\Large (M) \begin{cases}
\text{Given the coefficient matrix $K$ and the vector $F$, find $d$ s.t.} \\
Kd = F
\end{cases}$$
if we assume the inverse of $K$ exists and we have the solution :
$$d = K^{-1} F$$
where
$$K = [K_{AB}] = a(N_A,N_B)$$
$$F_A = (N_A,l) + N_A(0) h - a(N_A,N_{n+1})q$$
then the solution of the Galerkin Equation can be obtained at any point $x\in \Omega$ by equation $(1.6.6)$ as above.

`````ad-note

1. The matrix $K$ is Symmetric. This followsfromthe symmeric of $a(\cdot ,\cdot )$, that is : 
$$K_{AB} = a(N_A, N_B) = a(N_B,N_A) = K_{BA}$$

2. the finite element method for the given problem can be found

$$(S) \leftrightarrow (W) \approx (G) \leftrightarrow (M)$$

3. Sometimes It's also convenient to write 
$$u^h(x) = \sum^{n+1}_{A=1} N_A(x) d_A$$
where $d_{n+1} = q$
`````

#### 2) Example : problem of 1 and 2 degree of freedom
##### 1) 1-D problem
for $n = 1$ <mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">in the question above</mark>, the $u^h$ only consist of 1 unknown function, then $u^h = v^h + q^h = d_1N_1 + qN_2$, Then the only unknown is $d_1$. The shape functions must satisfy 
$$K = [K_{11}] = K_{11}\quad F = \left\{ F_1\right\}\quad  d= \left\{ d_1\right\} = d_1$$
also we let $N_1(x) = 1-x$ and $N_2(x) = x$, then : 
$$K_{11} = a(N_1,N_1) = \int_{0}^{1} N_{1,x},N_{1,x} dx = 1$$
so 
$$\begin{matrix}
F_1=(N_1, l ) + N_1(0) h- a(N_1, N_2) q \\
\qquad \qquad \space \space = \int_{0}^{1}(1-x) l(x) dx + h - \int_{0}^{1} N_{1,x}N_{2,x}dx q \\
= \int_{0}^{1} (1-x) l(x) dx + h + q\quad \space 
\end{matrix}$$
then $d^1 = K_{11}^{-1}F_1 = F_1$, so we get the solution of 1-D of freedom problem: 
$$u^{h}(x) = \left[\int_{0}^{1}(1-y)l(y)dy + h + q\right](1-x) + qx$$
at that time, we assume the solution under the different $l$ : 
at $l(y) = 0$, then 
$$u^h(x) = \left[\int_{0}^{1}(1-y)l(y) dy + h +q\right](1-x) + qx $$
we write it into the form:
$$\boxed{u(x) = q(1-x)h + \int_{x}^{1}\left\{ \int_{0}^{y} l(z) dz\right\}dy}$$
![[Chapter 1 One-Dimensional Boundary Value Problem 2023-03-16 17.01.31|200]]
for $l = 0$, 
$$\begin{matrix}
u(x) = h(1-x) +q  \quad \text{exact solution} \\
u^{(h)}(x) = h(1-x) + q \quad \text{numerical soltuion}
\end{matrix}$$
also, for $l = \rho = constant$ 
$$u(x) = u^{h}(x) = \frac{\rho(1-x)^2}{2} + h(1-x) + q$$
where the particular solution is: 
$$\frac{\rho (1- x)^2}{2}$$
note that on the node $u(0)$ and $u(1)$, the solution are exactly the same : 
$$u(0) = u^h(0) = \frac{\rho}{2} + h + q$$
also it can be derived when $l(x) = px$,the exact solution is the same as the numerical solution (derivation is put in the next part). 

##### 2) 2-D problem 
for case $n=2$, then $w^h = c_1 N_1 + c_2N_2$, where $N_1(1) = N_2(1) =0$, and $u^h = d_1 N_1 + d_2N_2 + qN_3$, where $N_3 = 1$. 
we can define $N_1, N_2, \text{ and } N_3$ as : 
$$N_1(x) = \begin{cases}
1-2x\qquad 0\leq x\leq \frac{1}{2} \\
0 \qquad \frac{1}{2}\leq x\leq  1
\end{cases}
\quad N_2(x) = \begin{cases}
2x\qquad 0\leq x\leq \frac{1}{2} \\ 
2(1-x) \quad \frac{1}{2}\leq x\leq  1
\end{cases}, \quad N_3(x) = \begin{cases}
0 \quad ...\\ 2x -1 \quad ....
\end{cases}$$

![[Chapter 1 One-Dimensional Boundary Value Problem 2023-03-14 21.46.50]]

using $K_{AB} = \int_{0}^{1/2}N_A, N_B dx + \int_{1/2}^{1} N_{A,x}, N_{B,x} dx$, then finally : 
$K_{11} = \int_{0}^{1/2} N_1 N_1dx = 4 \times 1/2 = 2$
$$K = 2\left[\begin{matrix}
1 & -1 \\ 
-1 & 2
\end{matrix}\right]$$
with the derivation process in the [[Compare of 2D  exact solution and numerical solution.pdf]] we know that 

in the case of $l(x) = 0,l(x) = p,l(x) =px$, the solutions can all derived to be the same. 

Also note that the $W^h$ is a continuous function and the derivation of it is Piecewise continuous. (not continuous at the boundary of each element).

## 5. Piecewise Linear Finite Element Space 
To define <mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">the general case</mark> in which $\mathcal{V}^h$ is $n$-dimensional, then we partition the domain into $n$ nonoverlapping subintervals. Which the typical subinterval us denoted by $[x_A, x_{A+1}]$, where $x_A < x_{A+1}$. $A = 1,2,... n$. So we require $x_1$ to be zero and $x_{n-1} = 1$, then the $x_A,x_{A+1},...$ are called ***nodal points***.
![[Chapter 1 One-Dimensional Boundary Value Problem 2023-03-16 22.23.04|350]]
then <mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">the shape functions</mark> are defined as :
$$N_A(x) = \begin{cases}
\frac{(x - x_{A-1})}{h_{A-1}} \quad x_{A-1} \leq x \leq x_A \\
\frac{(x_{A+1} - x)}{h_A} \quad  x_{A} \leq x_{A-1} \\
0 \qquad \text{elsewhere}
\end{cases}$$

where $\delta_{AB}$ is the Kronecker delta. 

A ==typical member $w^h \in \mathcal{V}^h$ has the form $\sum^{n}_{i=1} c_A N_A$ and appears as in Fig below.==
![[Chapter 1 One-Dimensional Boundary Value Problem 2023-03-16 22.33.07]]
also note the typical members of the $\delta^h$ are obtained by adding $q^h = qN_{n+1}$ to the typical members of $\mathcal{V}^h$, which ensures that $u^h(1) = q$

In this case the <mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">continuity condition is identically satisfied</mark> and the summation of integrals over the element interiors may be replaced by <mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">an integral over the entire domain</mark>. 

## 6. The Construction of Stiffness matrix $K$ 
The shape functions $N_A$, $A =1,2,....n +1$, are <mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">zero outside a neighborhood of node</mark> $A$. Also as a result, many of the entries of $K$ are zero. 
$$\boxed{K_{AB} = \int_{0}^{1}N_{A,x}N_{B,x}dx = 0\qquad(B>A+1)}$$
note the Symmetry of the matrix $K$ implies that <mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">the equation holds for</mark> $A>B+1$. 
The $K$ is ***banded***, that is :
$$K = \left[\begin{matrix}
K_{11} & K_{12} &  0 & ... \\
K_{21} & K_{22} & K_{23} & 0 & ....\\
0 & K_{32} & K_{33} & K_{34} & 0 & ...\\
... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... \\
0 & ... & &0 & K_{n, n-1} & K_n
\end{matrix}\right]$$

**Theorem** : The $n\times  n$ matrix $K$ is <mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">positive definite</mark>.
[[Proof of the positive definite of the Stiffness Matrix.pdf]]

## 7. Mathematical Analysis 
We let the $\delta(x) = \delta (x-y)$ denote the ***Dirac Delta function***, which is not a function in the classical sense but rather an<mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow"> operator defined by its action on the continuous functions</mark>. We let $w$ be continuous on $[0,1]$, then we have : 
$$\boxed{(w, \delta_y)= \int_{0}^{1}w(x) \delta(x-y) dx = w(y)}$$
The **Green's function problem** may be state as : 
Find a function $g$ such that : 
$$\begin{matrix}
g_{,xx} + \delta_y = 0 \quad \text{on }\Omega \\
g(1) = 0;\\
g_{,x}(0) = 0;
\end{matrix}$$
(we can compare it with the previous problem [[#1. Strong or Classical form of the 1-D boundary problem|Equation of 1-D FEM problem]])

The problem may be solved by way of formal calculation with **distribution of generalized functions** such as $\delta_y$ we note that the formal integral of the $\delta_y$ is ***Heaviside function***, which is shown in the fig below : 

![[Chapter 1 One-Dimensional Boundary Value Problem 2023-03-17 09.18.21|550]]

Then to solve the Green function problem, we integrate the $g_{,xx} + \delta_y = 0$ twice, then 
$$\begin{matrix}
g_{,x} + H_y = c_1 \\
g(x) + <x-y> = c_1 x + c_2
\end{matrix}$$
substitute the boundary condition into this function, we can easily derive that : 
$$g(x) = (1 - y) - <x-y>$$
Observe that the $g$ is piecewise linear (as the fig above), then if $y = x_A \text{ i.e.}\space  y\space   \text{is a node}$ and $g\in \mathcal{V}^h$, we can substitute the $u$ <mark style="background: transparent; color: yellow">in the example problem</mark> [[#2) Galerkin method|(Galerkin Method)]] by the $g(x)$ and the $l$ by $\delta_y$ and $q \text{ and } h$ by 0. then we have : 
$$\Large\boxed{a(w,g) = (w, \delta_y) = w(y)\tag{1.10.10}}$$
this function holds for all the continuous $w\in \mathcal{V}$

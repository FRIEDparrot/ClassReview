## (1) Quasi-Linear partial differential equations 
The governing equations of the flow is either written in the integral forms or partial differential equations. we firstly examine some mathematical properties of the partial differential form of the partial differential equations themselves. 

We will introduce three types of partial differential equations below : 

for quasi-linear equations : 
$$\begin{cases}
a_1 \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + b_1 \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + c_1 \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + d_1\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = f_1 \\ 
a_2 \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + b_2\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + c_2\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + d_2 \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = f_2
\end{cases}$$

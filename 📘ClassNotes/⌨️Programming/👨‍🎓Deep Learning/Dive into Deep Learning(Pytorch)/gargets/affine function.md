the affine function is defined as: 
$$y = Ax + c$$

A quick definition for linearity would be $f(洧논)$말s linear if
$$洧녭(洧띺洧논_{1}+洧띻洧논_2)=洧띺洧녭(洧논_1)+洧띻洧녭(洧논_2)$$
and can be defined as:
$$y = w_{1} x_{1} +  w_{2} x_{2} + \dots  + w_{n}x_{n}$$

It's easy to see that affine function is the linear function at $(\boldsymbol{x}, 1)$

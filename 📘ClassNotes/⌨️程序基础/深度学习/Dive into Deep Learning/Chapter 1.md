The best values of our model's parameters by minimizing the loss incurred on a set of some numbers of  examples collected for training
Also, doing well in the training data doesn't guarantee we will do well on unseen data, so we typically want split the available data into training set and the test set which is held out for evaluation. we typically report how our models perform on both partitions. 
When a model performs well on the training dataset but fails to generalize the unseen data, we say it's overfitting to the training data.

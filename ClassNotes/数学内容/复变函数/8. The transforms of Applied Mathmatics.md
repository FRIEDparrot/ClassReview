The virtues of employing an input of the form $Ae^{i\omega t}$  are : 
1. Compactness of notation  --> $\alpha cos(\omega t + \phi) + \beta sin(\omega t +  \psi)$ can be represented  by $Re(Ae^{i\omega t})$
2. The fact that the differentiation of the above (sinusoids) function amounts to multiplication by $i\omega$  -> replacing calculus by algebra
3. The fact the steady-state response of the system to the input will have the form of $e^{i\omega t}$

### 8.1 Fourier Series(Finite Fourier Transform)
For a decomposition of the $F(t)$, 
$$\omega_n = \frac{2\pi n}{L}$$
[[8. The transforms of Applied Mathmatics 2023-01-09 19.04.40.excalidraw|proof of the Fourier Series]]

then we have the Fourier Series: 
$$
F(t) = \sum^{\infty}_{-\infty} c_n e^{i n t}
$$
where
$$c_m = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int^{\pi}_{-\pi}F(t) e^{imt} dt$$
valid whenever the series above is uniformly convergent

**Definition : if F has period $2\pi$ and is integrable over $[-\pi, \pi]$, the  series with coefficients above is  called the Fourier Series for $F$ , and the numbers $c_n$ are called the Fourier  coefficients of $F$**

more generally, if $F$ has a period of $L$, then: 
$$F(t) = \sum^{\infty}_{-\infty} c_n e^{-i n\frac{2\pi t}{L}}$$
where
$$c_n = \frac{1}{L} \int^{L/2}_{-L/2} F(t) e^{-i n \frac{2\pi t}{L}} dt$$
then  we  introduce: 
$$F(t) =: f(e^{it})$$
and we can derive the equation of the Fourier transform from the following steps:

the Poisson formula ( the derivation can be referenced from the textbook)
$$u\left(re^{i\theta}\right) = \frac{1 - r^2}{2 \pi} \int^{\pi}_{-\pi} \frac{U(\phi)}{1 - 2r\cos(\theta - \phi) + r^2} d\phi$$

QULab Offers Three sampling based algorithms, including: 
1. Monte Carlo simulation 
2. Importance sampling 
3. Subset Sampling (MCMC simulation)


The Qulab contains the following Surrogate Model, Learning function, Reliability method and **Stopping criterion**:

Note that not only LF-based method and stability of beta is used, also stability of Pf is used. 

Derivation number function 
$$U(x) = \frac{|\hat{g}(x)|}{\hat{s}(x)}\qquad  P_{m} =  \Phi (-U(x))$$
